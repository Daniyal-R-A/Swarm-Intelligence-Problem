# Swarm-Intelligence-Problem
In this project, we will be applying swarm-based algorithm, specifically Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to solve complex Hospital Layout optimization problems. We will also build a simulation/visualization of a selected swarm algorithm to better understand how it works and how different parameters impact its performance.
